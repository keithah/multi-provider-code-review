# Example: Path-Based Intensity Configuration
#
# This file demonstrates how to configure different review intensities
# based on file path patterns. Use this as a starting point for your
# .github/multi-review.yml configuration.

# Enable path-based intensity (required)
path_based_intensity: true

# Default intensity for files not matching any pattern
path_default_intensity: standard

# Path patterns mapped to intensity levels
# Format: JSON string with array of {pattern, intensity} objects
# Patterns use glob syntax (*, **, ?)
#
# PRECEDENCE RULE: When multiple patterns match, highest intensity wins.
# Order: thorough > standard > light
#
# Examples:
# - src/core/** matches thorough, docs/** matches light
# - If a file matches both, thorough wins

# Provider counts per intensity (how many providers to use)

# Timeout per intensity (milliseconds)

# Prompt depth per intensity (how detailed the instructions)
intensity_prompt_depth:
  thorough: detailed  # Full context, comprehensive analysis

  light: brief        # Quick scan, obvious issues only

# Consensus thresholds per intensity (percentage of providers that must agree)
# Higher = more strict, requires more agreement
intensity_consensus_thresholds:
  thorough: 80  # 80% agreement for thorough review
  standard: 60  # 60% agreement for standard review
  light: 40     # 40% agreement for light review

# Severity filters per intensity (minimum severity to show inline)
# Valid values: critical, major, minor
intensity_severity_filters:
  thorough: minor    # Show all issues including minor
  standard: minor    # Show minor and above
  light: major       # Only show major and critical
