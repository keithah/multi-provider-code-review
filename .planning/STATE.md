# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Reduce friction from issue detection to fix application - developers can resolve code review findings instantly by clicking "Commit suggestion" rather than context-switching to their editor.

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Core Suggestion Formatting

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Core Suggestion Formatting)
Plan: 1 of 3 (Suggestion block formatter)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-05 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 8%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Core Suggestion Formatting | 1/3 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2min)
- Trend: Establishing baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Prompt LLMs for fixes during initial review (single-pass is faster than two-phase)
- Fallback to description-only (better to surface issue without fix than suppress finding)
- Use GitHub's native suggestion syntax (leverages built-in UI, no custom implementation needed)
- Use dynamic fence delimiter calculation (max backticks + 1) for robust escaping (01-01)
- Return empty string for empty/whitespace input (no partial suggestion blocks) (01-01)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 (Core Formatting):**
- Line number misalignment is primary failure mode - must use modern GitHub API parameters

**Phase 3 (Multi-Line Support):**
- Multi-line deletion edge cases need experimentation (community docs sparse)

**Phase 4 (Validation):**
- Consensus algorithm for code fixes requires design decisions (no standard patterns)
