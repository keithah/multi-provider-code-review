<objective>
Wire dormant Phase 4 validation and learning features into the runtime execution path.

Purpose: Phase 4 implemented full validation/learning infrastructure, but setup.ts instantiates components without the optional parameters. This gap closure activates the validation pipeline (SuppressionTracker, ProviderWeightTracker) and context-aware prompts (PromptEnricher).

Output: Updated src/setup.ts with full wiring of Phase 4 features.

**Architectural Note:** CodeGraph CANNOT be passed at setup time because it requires FileChange[] to build, which only becomes available after PR loading. PromptBuilder receives `undefined` for codeGraph at setup; the orchestrator can build and inject the graph later during review execution if needed.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Wire validation trackers into CommentPoster</name>
  <files>src/setup.ts</files>
  <action>
  In both `createComponentsForCLI` and `createComponents` functions:

  1. Add imports at top of file (if not already present):
     ```typescript
     import { SuppressionTracker } from './learning/suppression-tracker';
     import { ProviderWeightTracker } from './learning/provider-weights';
     ```

  2. In `createComponentsForCLI` function (starts around line 71):
     - After `const cacheStorage = new CacheStorage();` (line 112), add:
       ```typescript
       const suppressionTracker = new SuppressionTracker(cacheStorage, 'cli-mode');
       const providerWeightTracker = new ProviderWeightTracker(cacheStorage);
       ```
     - Update CommentPoster instantiation to pass these (currently at line 144):
       ```typescript
       const commentPoster = new CommentPoster(
         mockGitHubClient,
         true,
         config,
         suppressionTracker,
         providerWeightTracker
       );
       ```

  3. In `createComponents` function (starts around line 187):
     - After `const cacheStorage = new CacheStorage();` (line 233), add:
       ```typescript
       const suppressionTracker = new SuppressionTracker(cacheStorage, 'cli-mode');
       const providerWeightTracker = new ProviderWeightTracker(cacheStorage);
       ```
       Note: Use 'cli-mode' as repoKey for both functions. The SuppressionTracker key is per-storage-instance, and actual repo context is captured when recordDismissal/shouldSuppress are called with prNumber.
     - Update CommentPoster instantiation to pass these (currently at line 224):
       ```typescript
       const commentPoster = new CommentPoster(
         githubClient,
         config.dryRun,
         config,
         suppressionTracker,
         providerWeightTracker
       );
       ```

  Important: The cacheStorage variable already exists in both functions, so reuse it rather than creating a new one.
  </action>
  <verify>
  ```bash
  npm run build 2>&1 | head -20
  grep -n "new SuppressionTracker" src/setup.ts
  grep -n "new CommentPoster" src/setup.ts
  ```
  Build succeeds (or only shows unrelated orchestrator.ts error), grep shows SuppressionTracker instantiation and CommentPoster constructor with tracker params.
  </verify>
  <done>
  - CommentPoster in createComponents receives suppressionTracker and providerWeightTracker
  - CommentPoster in createComponentsForCLI receives suppressionTracker and providerWeightTracker
  - Both use consistent 'cli-mode' repoKey strategy
  - Build passes (ignoring unrelated orchestrator.ts issue)
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Wire PromptEnricher into PromptBuilder (without CodeGraph)</name>
  <files>src/setup.ts</files>
  <action>
  In both `createComponentsForCLI` and `createComponents` functions:

  1. Add import at top of file (if not already present):
     ```typescript
     import { PromptEnricher } from './learning/prompt-enrichment';
     ```

  2. In `createComponentsForCLI` function:
     - Create PromptEnricher AFTER suppressionTracker and feedbackTracker are created, BEFORE promptBuilder:
       ```typescript
       const promptEnricher = new PromptEnricher(suppressionTracker, feedbackTracker);
       ```
     - Update PromptBuilder instantiation (currently `new PromptBuilder(config)` at line 86):
       ```typescript
       const promptBuilder = new PromptBuilder(config, 'standard', promptEnricher, undefined);
       ```
       Note: Pass `undefined` for codeGraph because CodeGraph requires FileChange[] to build (via `graphBuilder.buildGraph(files)`), which is only available during PR review execution, NOT at setup time. The orchestrator can build the graph later and inject it if needed.

  3. In `createComponents` function:
     - Same pattern: Create PromptEnricher after suppressionTracker, before promptBuilder:
       ```typescript
       const promptEnricher = new PromptEnricher(suppressionTracker, feedbackTracker);
       ```
     - Update PromptBuilder instantiation (currently `new PromptBuilder(config)` at line 202):
       ```typescript
       const promptBuilder = new PromptBuilder(config, 'standard', promptEnricher, undefined);
       ```

  **ARCHITECTURAL LIMITATION (documented):**
  The graphBuilder exists (`config.graphEnabled ? new CodeGraphBuilder(...) : undefined`) but it only has `buildGraph(files: FileChange[]): Promise<CodeGraph>` - an async method requiring files. There is NO `getGraph()` method to retrieve a pre-built graph. The graph must be built DURING review execution when files are available, not at setup time. Pass `undefined` for now; future work could inject the graph during orchestration.
  </action>
  <verify>
  ```bash
  npm run build 2>&1 | head -20
  grep -n "new PromptBuilder" src/setup.ts
  grep -n "PromptEnricher" src/setup.ts
  ```
  Build succeeds (ignoring unrelated orchestrator.ts error), grep shows PromptEnricher instantiation and PromptBuilder receiving enricher + undefined for graph.
  </verify>
  <done>
  - PromptBuilder in createComponents receives promptEnricher and undefined for codeGraph
  - PromptBuilder in createComponentsForCLI receives promptEnricher and undefined for codeGraph
  - Architectural limitation documented: CodeGraph requires files unavailable at setup time
  - Build passes (ignoring unrelated orchestrator.ts issue)
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify build succeeds</name>
  <files>None (verification only)</files>
  <action>
  Run TypeScript build to ensure the wiring changes compile correctly.

  Note: There is a KNOWN unrelated bug in orchestrator.ts line 473 causing test failures (Promise not awaited). This is NOT related to this plan's changes. Focus on verifying that setup.ts compiles without errors.

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  Expected outcome:
  - setup.ts compiles successfully
  - The only error (if any) should be the existing orchestrator.ts line 473 issue
  - No new TypeScript errors from the wiring changes

  If setup.ts-specific errors occur:
  - Check import paths are correct
  - Verify constructor signatures match (CommentPoster, PromptBuilder, PromptEnricher)
  - Ensure suppressionTracker/feedbackTracker are created before PromptEnricher
  </action>
  <verify>
  ```bash
  npm run build 2>&1 | grep -E "(setup\.ts|error TS)"
  ```
  Output should show NO errors referencing setup.ts. Any errors should only reference orchestrator.ts (the known unrelated bug).
  </verify>
  <done>
  - setup.ts compiles without TypeScript errors
  - All wiring changes are type-correct
  - Known orchestrator.ts bug is unrelated and does not block this plan
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After completing all tasks:

1. Build verification:
   ```bash
   npm run build 2>&1 | grep -v orchestrator.ts | head -20
   ```
   Should show no errors (filtering out the known orchestrator.ts issue).

2. Grep verification (key wiring patterns):
   ```bash
   grep -n "new SuppressionTracker" src/setup.ts
   grep -n "new ProviderWeightTracker" src/setup.ts
   grep -n "new PromptEnricher" src/setup.ts
   grep -n "new CommentPoster" src/setup.ts
   grep -n "new PromptBuilder" src/setup.ts
   ```
   Each grep should show the component instantiated with the new dependencies.
