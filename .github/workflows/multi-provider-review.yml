    # SECURITY: pull_request trigger (not pull_request_target) prevents fork PRs
    # from accessing repository secrets (OPENROUTER_API_KEY, etc.) by default.
    # GitHub runs fork PR workflows with empty secrets UNLESS the repository
    # setting "Send secrets to workflows from pull requests" is enabled.
    #
    # CRITICAL ASSUMPTION: This workflow requires that "Send secrets to workflows
    # from pull requests" is DISABLED in repository settings (default/recommended).
    # If enabled, fork PRs could access secrets, which is a security risk.
    # See: Settings → Actions → General → Fork pull request workflows
    #
    # Additional security layers in this workflow:
    # - Explicit fork detection and secret validation (line 97-110)
    # - Conditional job execution that skips fork PRs (line 132)
    # - Provider allowlist validation for user-supplied model names
  # Note: pull_request_review trigger removed to prevent duplicate runs
  # when the bot posts its own review comment

# Cancel in-progress runs for the same commit to prevent duplicate reviews
# Strategy: Use PR number + head SHA for pull requests, github.sha for push
# - For pull_request: group by PR number and head commit SHA
# - For push: group by pushed commit SHA
# - For workflow_dispatch: group by input PR number and current SHA
# This ensures proper isolation and prevents race conditions between different PRs
concurrency:
  # Use distinct prefixes for different event types to prevent cross-event cancellation
  # - pull_request: pr-{number}-{head_sha}
  # - push: push-{sha}
  # - workflow_dispatch: dispatch-{pr_number}-{sha}

# Permissions: Principle of least privilege
# Only grant the minimum permissions required for code review functionality
# Security rationale:
# - contents: read - Required to checkout code and read PR diffs (minimal read access)
# - pull-requests: write - Required to post review comments and inline suggestions (no merge access)
# - actions: read - Required for concurrency control to prevent duplicate reviews (read-only)
# NOT granted: contents: write (cannot modify code), issues: write (cannot create issues)
permissions:
  contents: read        # Read repository code and PR diffs
  pull-requests: write  # Post review comments and summaries
  actions: read         # Check workflow status (for concurrency control)
